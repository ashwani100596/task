# what is the use of github.


git is a open source commmand line version control system
So, Git is a version control system,  When developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release

Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.

so GitHub is a website and service that provide all these services.
